  Algorithm steps:

  1) Before move generation, generate all cross-checks for the row's columns
  2) Find all the anchor points for the board
  3) For all anchor points (faesible from rack), generate the left part of possible words
  4) For all anchor points (faesible from rack), generate the right part of possible words
  5) Combine letters multipliers as going, and compute word multipliers when end of word is found
