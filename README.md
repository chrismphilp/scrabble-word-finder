Based on The World's Fastest Scrabble Program, which
can be seen [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf).

The dictionary used is Collins Scrabble Words from 2019, 
which can be viewed in <b>collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt</b>.
<i>Any dictionary can be used - currently only supporting upper
case text</i>.

This has been implemented in Scala, including tests that
simulate the bot playing a full solo game of Scrabble.
